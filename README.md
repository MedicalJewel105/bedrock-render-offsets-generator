# What is render_offsets

If you are an add-on creator and you want to add an item (1.16.100+) with texture bigger than 16x16, you will need to add render offsets to your item so it renders correctly in-game. Render offsets component is in your item's code, in components.
You can see render offsets syntax [here](https://wiki.bedrock.dev/items/items-16.html#minecraft-render-offsets).

# How to use

Clone this repository and run `main.py`. It should ask you to open your texture file, if not - rerun the script. You can see the result in terminal or in render_offsets.json file in the same folder script is.
